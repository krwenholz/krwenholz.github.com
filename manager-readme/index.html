<h1 id="motivation">Motivation</h1>
<p>These are some words to introduce myself, especially as a manager. While these words don't
replace a real first impressions, &quot;in person&quot; conversation, I hope they lay the foundation
for a juicier chat.</p>
<p>This document is subject <a href="https://github.com/krwenholz/krwenholz.github.io/content/manager_readme.md">to change</a>.
I have some strong ideas and opinions, especially about myself, but I'm optimistic they'll change.</p>
<h1 id="my-role">My role</h1>
<p>I like to think of myself as an Environment Cultivator. My job as an engineering leader
is to</p>
<ul>
<li>support growth of individuals and the team</li>
<li>drive trust so we can have real conversations</li>
<li>provide cover when necessary</li>
</ul>
<p>All in service of creating an environment for success.</p>
<p>I also happen to have experience engineering things and like to get into the weeds with
folks, sometimes. That's not usually the most valuable thing I can be doing for my team,
but it's good for building empathy (both ways) and keeping my technical skills sharp.</p>
<h1 id="backstory">Backstory</h1>
<p>I was born and raised in Montana. I like to convince folks I grew up wrestling bears. I
did not, but you wouldn't believe how many people believe this.</p>
<p>My wife and I met at University of Puget Sound, married right after college. Our dog entered
the picture in 2019. She's too smart for her own good.</p>
<p>In my spare time I like to read, play games, and do some woodworking. Some photos can be
found <a href="https://photos.google.com/share/AF1QipPPR5N7AuE28ucrJPX9brb6XxazXH6ohPlECQ_gxl3nRAepbHHwU6n-_xrqe8Hu0g?key=UHhNRUVld1NlZGc1OGtUWFlpZXNhN0tGUUZIbmtn">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="books-and-such-on-my-mind">Books and such on my mind</h2>
<p>These are books, articles, and talks I'm constantly mulling over: i.e. they left an impression.</p>

<h1 id="go-to-tools-tactics">Go to tools/tactics</h1>
<h2 id="successful-conversations">Successful conversations</h2>
<p>I believe in meetings with an agenda (purpose), conflict (the healthy kind that means
we're tackling thorny problems), and the right audience. Sometimes the last two look a
little like gamesmanship; I promise they aren't. I just happen to be a big believer in
focus and timing.</p>
<h2 id="1-1s">1:1s</h2>
<p>It's amazing what kind of conversations can come up with guaranteed time every week. I leave
the agenda up to my reports but will always have something to discuss. These are especially
fun as a walking meeting.</p>
<h2 id="a-little-bit-of-process-systems">A little bit of process (systems)</h2>
<p>I love having goals, but it's impossible to meet them reliably if you're tackling every
one as a wholly new problem. Instead, I tend to focus on putting systems in place. Scott Adams
has <a href="https://www.scottadamssays.com/2013/11/18/goals-vs-systems/">a great post about this</a>.</p>
<h2 id="vim">Vim</h2>
<p>I'm just a really big fan of doing things in plain text on the command line, from coding
to note taking.</p>
<h1 id="what-do-i-really-need-from-my-team">What do I really need from my team?</h1>
<h2 id="feedback">Feedback</h2>
<p>Keep it blunt, rooted in facts/examples, and timely. Please don't wait to tell me during
the yearly review. This goes for feedback about my performance and that of the team (which
are really the same thing). Don't hold back. I won't mind. I will, however, mind if I find
out you did hold back!</p>
<h3 id="when-can-you-give-me-feedback-and-how-should-you-deliver-it">When can you give me feedback and how should you deliver it?</h3>
<p>Any time. I'm happy to take feedback in the middle of a meeting if it's delivered with good
intentions and grace. If you want a private chat, put time on my calendar or just ask me!
I'm also open to just chatting over Slack if video/voice/in person isn't your thing.</p>
<h2 id="ownership">Ownership</h2>
<p>I expect folks to demonstrate extreme levels of ownership. As a team of adults, nobody is
working entirely alone, but they are responsible for whatever they get assigned and agree
to do. Sometimes this means asking for help and other times it means questioning or pushing
back!</p>
<h2 id="craft">Craft</h2>
<p>I believe software &quot;engineering&quot; is a craft. That means I want a team dedicated to learning,
challenging themselves, interested in all aspects of the problem, and a respect for the
process. A lot of times this shows up in code and designs, but it also comes down to being
professional:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicating clearly</li>
<li>helping share knowledge via brownbags, wikis, etc.</li>
<li>respecting boundaries like working hours</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="things-i-m-working-on">Things I'm working on</h1>
<ul>
<li>Giving timely and measured feedback is really hard without good systems in place. Having
been raised (in the career sense) on teams with a disdain for sprints and business deadlines,
I misunderstood some of the value in committing a team or individual to deadlines. I now
understand that concrete commitments can help create measurable progress and let folks know
early that something is wrong. Getting good systems in place so the measurement happens
naturally is a work in progress.</li>
<li>Managing up is hard. I'm still fine tuning the best format for me to present information
to leadership teams. Sometimes, a slideshow seems to work, and others it's a press release.
(Full Amazon!) Striking a balanced level of detail can be hard.</li>
<li>Disconnecting from Slack. I built some bad habits at the start of the pandemic and check
Slack in the evening more than I care to admit. First step is admitting you have a problem,
right? Historically, I've been great at separating work and life. I try to drive that into
my teams, but it can be hard with the urgency and fun of a tight-knit group.</li>
