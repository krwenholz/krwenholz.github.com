I asked. She said yes. It really was that easy!  Here are some of the
fun details Rachel wants to share with you:

After endless warm Seattle summer days this was a cloudy day with thunder and
lightning on June 25, 2013.

We met up near Amazon in downtown Seattle after Kyle got off work, and
we waited at the bus stop for the rose gardens by Woodland Park Zoo. Soon
enough, it started pouring rain (very atypical for those days in late June).
Kyle showed me a chocolate cupcake he bought just for me but said I had to wait
to eat it until we got to the rose gardens. When the bus finally came, we
thought about just going straight home and visiting the rose gardens another
day. We decided, however, to rough it out because we love the rain! Luckily the
rain subsided by the time we arrived at the gardens.

Kyle brought his camera and took lots of pictures - quite atypical of him. We
found a bench under a huge tree and sat down to eat that cupcake. I
unwrapped the cupcake and took a bite. It was a _delicious_ cupcake. After taking
a few more bites I realized there was a hole in the bottom of the cupcake and
a little green plastic bag sticking out of the hole. Confused, I pulled out
the bag, opened it up, and pulled out a pink rubber ring.

I held it up to Kyle with a questioning look and said, “There’s a ring inside
my cupcake.” He got down on one knee in front me and took my free hand. He told
me that he loved me and asked me to, “adventure with him for the rest of our
lives!” I said “Yes!”

. . . . Oh wait, before I said yes, I first asked, “Are you serious?” Once
Kyle assured me he was indeed serious, I of course responded with, “Yes!!!”
