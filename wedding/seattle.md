Seattle is great, and we're excited for you to explore the home we fell in love
in. Here are some places we think you should visit while here:

* [Gas Works Park](http://www.seattle.gov/parks/park_detail.asp?ID=293)
* [Ballard Locks](http://www.seattle.gov/tour/locks.htm)
* [Pike Place Market](http://www.pikeplacemarket.org/)
* [EMP](http://www.empmuseum.org/): it's a museum for music and "stuff",
not an awesome physics term.
