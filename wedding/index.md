# We're tying the knot!

Here, you can find all sorts of information about our venues, food, times,
registry, and anything else we want you to know when you join us for the
ceremony and reception on November 9th. The tabs (above) will give you some
fun bits of information, but the bulk of your burning questions are answered
here, in one nice and tidy place.

## Q: Where is the wedding?
## A: Ballard Church
You can come join us in [this](http://www.ballardchurch.com/) gorgeous house 
of worship for our ceremony.

## Q: Where is the reception?
## A: The Canal
It's awesome. You can even find directions on [the site](http://www.thecanalseattle.com/index.htm).

## Q: When does it all happen?

## Q: Have you registered with anyone?
## A: Yes. The Internet.
First, don't think you need to get us anything. We're really excited if you
can even make it out. If a gift is in the cards, though, read on!

Second, we have a small place and lots of stuff.  We're well set with kitchen,
bedroom and even living room items.  (You should see the apartment; it's
awesome.) To make it easy, we made a registry you can visit
[here](http://www.myregistry.com/visitors/giftlist.aspx?sid=764054a1-7730-4ee4-b214-b324cd19be00).
Welcome to the twenty first century: no specific store!
