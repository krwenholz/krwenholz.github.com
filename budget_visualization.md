Use the tool below to understand how your buckets of wealth change over time.
You can set up multiple accounts and add "Income Events". An income event is
anything that happens monthly to your account. You can name these and specify
how the event changes your account:

*    Flat change: a positive or negative amount like your paycheck
*    Percent yearly change: a positive or negative percentage like interest
     in your bank account or depreciation

Use the button and boxes near the bottom to save or load your session.
