Hi there!

My name is Kyle Wenholz, and this is my attempt at a website.
I hope you enjoy your stay.

Over five years ago, I finished studying Mathematics and (two degrees yeah!)
Computer Science at [University of Puget Sound](http://pugetsound.edu),
in the lovely city of Tacoma, Washington. Post-graduation, I started work
at an awesome book company writing software to manage reverse-logistics.
After learning more lessons than this paragraph will allow, I
headed off to work for a modest cloud services provider (formerly known as
a search engine company). Both are what you'd call great gigs with brilliant
co-workers, challenges, and perks. I've learned to ask hard questions,
work _with_ users, write reliable and performant software, plan projects,
work with a business team, and have fun while doing it. And now... I work
at a [Seattle-based startup](http://karat.io/) improving the world's
interviewing and hiring tools, one byte at a time.

You can check out some of my publicly visible projects [here](/projects)
and read more about my work history in my handy-dandy
[resume](https://github.com/krwenholz/Resume/blob/master/resume.pdf).
