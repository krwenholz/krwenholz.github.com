#Who is Kyle Wenholz?#

### A student ###
This guy goes to [University of Puget Sound](http://pugetsound.edu)!  He studies 
Mathematics and Computer Science (yes, two different degrees), and loves every
minute of being on the beautiful campus he has come to call home.

### A Mathemagician ###
He studies it, loves it, and pretends to be good at it some of the time.  You'll
catch him slip up pretty often, but he likes to learn this incredibly challenging
subject.

#### A Computer Scientist ##
This one is definitely a work in progress, but Kyle gets better every day, 
learning more than he imagined in a field he never imagined being in.  This 
site is a great reminder for him of how far he's come.

### A semi-pro ###
(Coming soon.)
Check out his resume!

### Not a third-person omniscient narrator ###
I'm really not.  Writing in the third person is just a fun way to explore what 
I think about myself, and include a really cool section title.
